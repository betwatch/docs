# Betslip Automation
The Betwatch browser extension can automatically populate bookmaker betslips with your selections when you click on a price.

In order to enable this feature, you must first enable the 'Betslip Prefill' setting in your Betwatch preferences.
To access your preferences, click on the three dots next to the search bar (in the top left) and select 'Preferences'. Select the 'Betting' tab and enable the 'Betslip Prefill' setting.

Betslip prefill is fast. It will automatically open a new tab and fill in your betslip with your selection and desired stake. **You must confirm the bet yourself.**
