# Creating Alerts

Alerts are always sent to the browser as a popup and sound. You can also configure [Telegram](#telegram) as a notification channel, so that you can directly get alerts to your phone in realtime.

## Overview

In the alert creation dialog, you have a couple of different options.

1. **Bookmakers** - You can select which bookmakers you want to receive alerts for. If you select multiple bookmakers, you will receive alerts for any of the bookmakers that you have selected.
2. **Price** - You can select a price that you want to receive alerts for.

You can set price alerts for bookmakers that have not yet put out markets, and you will be notified when they do.

## Telegram

Telegram is a free messaging app that is available on all platforms. It is a great way to receive alerts on your phone.

You will need to [register for a Telegram account](https://telegram.org/) if you do not already have one. You will then have to download the relevant app for your device.

Once connected to your Telegram account - you will need to create a new chat with the bot and send a message to it. This will allow the bot to send you messages. The bot is called [@betwatch_alert_bot](https://t.me/betwatch_alert_bot).
