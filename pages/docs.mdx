# Betwatch API

## What is an API?

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service. If you don't know what this is - then you probably don't need it ðŸ™‚.

## How can I use the Betwatch API?

The Betwatch API requires a separate subscription. You can subscribe to the API by contacting us at [api@betwatch.com](mailto:api@betwatch.com). API costs are relative to the amount of data you want to access. We offer a free trial for new users.
