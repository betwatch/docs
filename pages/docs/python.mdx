# Python SDK

The Betwatch Python SDK is a Python library that allows you to interact with the Betwatch API from your Python code in an easy and intuitive way.

## Installation

To install the Betwatch Python SDK, you can use pip package manager. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash copy
pip install betwatch
```

## Examples

[Full examples (including async) are available in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/betwatch/betwatch-sdk-python/tree/main/examples)

## Usage

The Betwatch SDK provides clients for both synchronous and asynchronous usage. The synchronous client is the default `BetwatchClient`, and the asynchronous client is available as `BetwatchAsyncClient`. The following examples use the synchronous client, but the asynchronous client provides all of the same functions that can be `await`ed.

All SDK is fully typed, meaning that you will get autocomplete and type hints in your code editor, making it easy to explore the SDK and find the right methods and attributes.

### Getting Started

Use the `connect` method to create a client instance. You can pass your API key as the first argument, or set the `BETWATCH_API_KEY` environment variable.

```python copy
import betwatch

client = betwatch.connect() # the api key can also be passed as the first argument

# or using the asyncio client
async_client = betwatch.connect_async()
```

### Get Races and Prices

The following examples use the concepts from the [documention section](#documentation) of this page.

```python copy
# be sure to import all relevant types
from betwatch.types import (
    Bookmaker,
    MarketPriceType,
    MeetingType,
    RaceProjection,
    RacesFilter,
)

# define the projection of the returned data
# we can filter out for certain bookmakers as well as define whether we want market data or flucs
projection = RaceProjection(
    markets=True,
    place_markets=False,
    flucs=True,
    links=False,
    betfair=False,
    bookmakers=[Bookmaker.SPORTSBET, Bookmaker.BLUEBET],
)

# define the filter for the query
# here we can filter by date, type of meeting, and various other parameters
races_filter = RacesFilter(
    date_from=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7),
    date_to=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=2),
    types=[MeetingType.THOROUGHBRED],  # filter on a race type
    has_riders=["bowman", "mccoy"],  # filter on any race containing these riders
)

races = client.get_races(projection, races_filter)
print(f"Found {len(races)} matching the query")
for race in races:
    print(race)
    # make sure the race has runners
    if race.runners:
        # loop through each runner in the race
        for runner in race.runners:
            print(runner) # types have a __str__ method that prints the name of the runner

            # make sure the runner has bookmaker markets
            if not runner.bookmaker_markets:
                print("No bookmaker markets for this runner")
                continue

            # loop through each market for the runner
            for market in runner.bookmaker_markets:
                print(market) # types have a __str__ method that prints the market details

                # get the fixed win market price
                if market.fixed_win:
                    print(f"Fixed Win Price: {market.fixed_win.price}")

                    # iterate through each fluc for the market
                    if market.fixed_win.flucs:
                        for fluc in market.fixed_win.flucs:
                            print(fluc)

```

## Documentation

### RaceProjection

A `RaceProjection` can be used to specify which fields should be returned from a race request. Smaller responses mean faster responses, as a `Race` object can be quite large, especially with a lot of markets and fluctuations.

```python copy
from betwatch import RaceProjection, Bookmaker

projection = RaceProjection(
    markets=True, # return fixed win markets
    place_markets=False, # don't return fixed place markets
    flucs=True, # return flucs for each market
    links=False, # don't return any race links (e.g. to the racecard)
    betfair=False, # don't return betfair markets
    bookmakers=[Bookmaker.SPORTSBET, Bookmaker.BLUEBET], # only return markets for these bookmakers
)
```

### RacesFilter

A `RacesFilter` must be used to define search criteria when searching for races using the SDK. If

```python copy
from betwatch import RacesFilter, MeetingType
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

races_filter = RacesFilter(
    limit: int = 100, # limit the number of results returned, this number will be capped depending on your query
    offset: int = 0, # offset the results by this number, used for pagination
    types: Optional[List[Union[MeetingType, str]]] = [MeetingType.THOROUGHBRED], # filter on a race type
    tracks: Optional[List[str]] = None, # filter on a track
    locations: Optional[List[str]] = None, # filter on a location
    has_bookmakers: Optional[List[Bookmaker]] = None, # filter only if the race has markets from these bookmakers
    has_runners: Optional[List[str]] = None, # filter if it has specific runners
    has_trainers: Optional[List[str]] = None, # filter if it has specific trainers
    has_riders: Optional[List[str]] = ["bowman", "mccoy"], # filter on any race containing these riders
    date_from: Optional[datetime] = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7), # filter on a date range, defaults to today only
    date_to: Optional[datetime] = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=2),
)
```
