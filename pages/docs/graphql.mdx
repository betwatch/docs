# GraphQL API Documentation

## Introduction to GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. Unlike REST, which exposes a fixed set of predefined endpoints, GraphQL allows you to request only the data you need by sending a single query. This makes it more flexible and efficient, especially when working with large or complex data sets.

## Getting Started

To make queries to the Betwatch.com GraphQL API, use the endpoint `api.betwatch.com/query`. There is also a [playground](https://api.betwatch.com/playground) endpoint you can use for exploring the API and testing your queries. Note that authentication is required; you must pass your API key as the `X-API-KEY` header in your requests.

If you would like access to the API, it requires a separate subscription fee. Please email [support@betwatch.com](mailto:support@betwatch.com) to request access.

## Example Queries

### Query a Single Race

```graphql copy
race(id: $id) {
    __typename
    id
    betfairMapping {
        win
        place
    }
    meeting {
        __typename
        id
        track
        location
        type
        date
    }
    name
    number
    status
    startTime
    distance
    results
    links {
        bookmaker
        navLink
    }
    runners {
        __typename
        id
        number
        name
        trainerName
        riderName
        scratchedTime
        betfairMarkets {
        __typename
        id
        sp
        marketName
        totalMatched
        marketTotalMatched
        back {
            price
            size
            lastUpdated
        }
        lay {
            price
            size
            lastUpdated
        }
        }
        bookmakerMarkets(bookmakers: $bookmakers, bookmakersWithFlucs: $bookmakersWithFlucs) {
        __typename
        id
        bookmaker
        fixedWin {
            flucs {
            price
            lastUpdated
            }
            openingPrice
            price
            lastUpdated
        }
        fixedPlace {
            flucs {
            price
            lastUpdated
            }
            openingPrice
            price
            lastUpdated
        }
        }
    }
}
```

### Query Multiple Races

```graphql copy
races(dateFrom: $dateFrom, dateTo: $dateTo, andDates: $andDates) {
    id
    meeting {
        id
        location
        track
        type
        date
    }
    name
    number
    status
    distance
    startTime
    runners {
        id
        name
        number
        trainerName
        riderName
    }
}
```

For more information on the available query options, refer to the API reference below.

## API Reference

The Betwatch.com GraphQL API currently supports the following two queries:

### `race(id: ID!): Race!`

Retrieve a single race by its ID.

### `races(andDates: [String!], dateFrom: String, dateTo: String, hasBookmakers: [String!], hasRiders: [String!], hasRunners: [String!], hasTrainers: [String!], limit: Int, locations: [String!], offset: Int, tracks: [String!], types: [RaceType!]): [Race!]!`

Retrieve a list of races based on the provided filters.

- `dateFrom` is the earliest date to include in the results. The date must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `dateTo` is the latest date to include in the results. The date must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `andDates` is a list of additional dates to include in the results. The dates must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `hasBookmakers` is a list of bookmakers to include in the results.
- `hasRiders` is a list of riders to include in the results.
- `hasRunners` is a list of runners to include in the results.
- `hasTrainers` is a list of trainers to include in the results. A subset of the name will still match.
- `limit` is the maximum number of results to return. The default is 100.
- `locations` is a list of locations/states to include in the results. These will match the TAB locations.
- `offset` is the number of results to skip before returning the results. The default is 0.
- `tracks` is a list of tracks to include in the results.
- `types` is a list of race types to include in the results. Options are `Thoroughbred`, `Greyhound`, or `Harness`
