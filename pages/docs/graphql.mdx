# GraphQL API Documentation

## Introduction to GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. Unlike REST, which exposes a fixed set of predefined endpoints, GraphQL allows you to request only the data you need by sending a single query. This makes it more flexible and efficient, especially when working with large or complex data sets.

## Getting Started

To make queries to the Betwatch.com GraphQL API, use the endpoint `api.betwatch.com/query`. There is also a [playground](https://api.betwatch.com/playground) endpoint you can use for exploring the API and testing your queries. Note that authentication is required; you must pass your API key as the `X-API-KEY` header in your requests.

```http request
POST https://api.betwatch.com/query
X-API-KEY: <your-api-key>
```

If you would like access to the API, it requires a separate subscription fee. Please email [support@betwatch.com](mailto:support@betwatch.com) to request access.

## Example Queries

### Query a Single Race

```graphql copy
race(id: $id) {
    id
    betfairMapping {
        win
        place
    }
    meeting {
        id
        track
        location
        type
        date
    }
    name
    number
    status
    startTime
    distance
    results
    links {
        bookmaker
        navLink
    }
    runners {
        id
        number
        name
        trainerName
        riderName
        scratchedTime
        betfairMarkets {
            id
            sp
            marketName
            totalMatched
            marketTotalMatched
            back {
                price
                size
                lastUpdated
            }
            lay {
                price
                size
                lastUpdated
            }
        }
        bookmakerMarkets(bookmakers: $bookmakers, bookmakersWithFlucs: $bookmakersWithFlucs) {
            id
            bookmaker
            fixedWin {
                flucs {
                    price
                    lastUpdated
                }
                openingPrice
                price
                lastUpdated
            }
            fixedPlace {
                flucs {
                    price
                    lastUpdated
                }
                openingPrice
                price
                lastUpdated
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Query Multiple Races

```graphql copy
races(dateFrom: $dateFrom, dateTo: $dateTo, andDates: $andDates) {
    id
    meeting {
        id
        location
        track
        type
        date
    }
    name
    number
    status
    distance
    startTime
    runners {
        id
        name
        number
        trainerName
        riderName
    }
}
```

For more information on the available query options, refer to the API reference below.

### Full Example (cURL)

```bash copy
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-KEY: <your-api-key>" -d '{
  "query": "query ($dateFrom: String, $dateTo: String, $andDates: Boolean) {
    races(dateFrom: $dateFrom, dateTo: $dateTo, andDates: $andDates) {
      id
      meeting {
        id
        location
        track
        type
        date
      }
      name
      number
      status
      distance
      startTime
      runners {
        id
        name
        number
        trainerName
        riderName
      }
    }
  }",
  "variables": {
    "dateFrom": "2023-05-01",
    "dateTo": "2023-05-31",
    "andDates": ["2023-02-02"]
  }
}' https://api.betwatch.com/query
```

### Full Example (Python Requests)
Although it is recommended to use the [Python SDK](/docs/python), you can also use the [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) (or any other) library to make requests to the API.
```python copy
import requests
import json

url = "https://api.betwatch.com/query"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-API-KEY": "<your-api-key>"
}
data = {
    "query": """
        query ($dateFrom: String, $dateTo: String, $andDates: [String!], $limit: Int, $offset: Int) {
            races(dateFrom: $dateFrom, dateTo: $dateTo, andDates: $andDates, limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
                id
                meeting {
                    id
                    location
                    track
                    type
                    date
                }
                name
                number
                status
                distance
                startTime
                runners {
                    id
                    name
                    number
                    trainerName
                    riderName
                }
            }
        }
    """,
    "variables": {
        "dateFrom": "2023-05-01",
        "dateTo": "2023-05-31",
        "andDates": ["2023-02-02"],
        "limit": 10,
        "offset": 0
    }
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

# Access the response content
print(response.json())
```


## API Reference

The Betwatch.com GraphQL API currently supports the following two queries:

### `race(id: ID!): Race!`

Retrieve a single race by its ID.

### `races(andDates: [String!], dateFrom: String, dateTo: String, hasBookmakers: [String!], hasRiders: [String!], hasRunners: [String!], hasTrainers: [String!], limit: Int, locations: [String!], offset: Int, tracks: [String!], types: [RaceType!]): [Race!]!`

Retrieve a list of races based on the provided filters.

- `dateFrom` is the earliest date to include in the results. The date must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `dateTo` is the latest date to include in the results. The date must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `andDates` is a list of additional dates to include in the results. The dates must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `hasBookmakers` is a list of bookmakers to include in the results.
- `hasRiders` is a list of riders to include in the results.
- `hasRunners` is a list of runners to include in the results.
- `hasTrainers` is a list of trainers to include in the results. A subset of the name will still match.
- `limit` is the maximum number of results to return. The default is 100.
- `locations` is a list of locations/states to include in the results. These will match the TAB locations.
- `offset` is the number of results to skip before returning the results. The default is 0.
- `tracks` is a list of tracks to include in the results.
- `types` is a list of race types to include in the results. Options are `Thoroughbred`, `Greyhound`, or `Harness`
