# Custom Layouts

The default Betwatch layout will display the best available price, along with the TAB price fluctuations since the market opened. You can customise the layout to suit your needs. To do this, click on the ‘Layout’ button in the top left corner of the Betwatch window, and select 'Customise Layouts'.

Spend some time clicking around in this window. You can change the name and add a number of custom columns.

## Customisation Options

1. **Add Columns** - Click this button to add a new column to the layout. You can then select the type of data you want to display in the column. For `Notes` columns, you can also change the name of the column, and the width of the column.
2. **Column Type** - Select the type of data you want to display in the column. You can select from the following options:
   - `Fixed Win` - The fixed win price for the runner.
   - `Fixed Place` - The fixed place price for the runner.
   - `Fixed Win Flucs` - The fixed win price fluctuations for the runner.
   - `Fixed Place Flucs` - The fixed place price fluctuations for the runner.
   - `Betfair` - The Betfair price for the runner. There are lots of options for this column.
   - `Other` - Other columns such as _Best Price_ and _Notes_. Notes are useful for storing information about the runner, such as comments or rated prices.
3. **Show Remaining Bookmakers** - Configure the behaviour of any bookmakers that aren't explicitly added to this custom layout. You can choose to hide the remaining bookmakers, or show them in a specific format.
4. **Column Lock** - Lock the column so that it does not move when you sort a runner by price. This is useful if you want to keep a column in a specific position.
